# Build Your Own X

Welcome to **Build Your Own X** – a collection of engineering-focused projects where I rebuild core systems and tools from scratch to understand how they work under the hood. These projects are learning-focused and meant to demystify technologies by reimplementing them with minimal abstractions.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Language |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 🔧 `build-your-own-compiler` | A minimal compiler for a toy language, with parsing, AST generation, and code generation. | C / Rust / Python |
| 🗃 `build-your-own-redis` | A simplified in-memory key-value store inspired by Redis. Supports basic commands and persistence. | Go / Rust |
| 📡 `build-your-own-http-server` | A basic HTTP server that handles routing, headers, and simple concurrency. | Node.js / Python |
| 🔤 `build-your-own-regex-engine` | A regular expression engine with NFA/DFA implementation. | Rust / C++ |
| 🧠 `build-your-own-neural-network` | Neural network implementation from scratch, including backpropagation. | Python |
| 📦 `build-your-own-package-manager` | A tiny package manager that can resolve dependencies and install packages from a repo. | Rust / Go |

## Goals

- ✅ Learn by building real systems
- ✅ Understand the inner workings of complex technologies
- ✅ Reinforce CS fundamentals (data structures, networking, OS, etc.)
- ✅ Produce clear, minimal, educational code

## Structure

Each project includes:

- 📖 Explanation in `docs/`
- 🧪 Tests in `tests/`
- 📦 Minimal dependencies
- 🚀 Simple CLI for usage
- 🛠️ Code comments and diagrams where necessary

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmSharma42306/build-your-own-x.git
   cd build-your-own-x
